# UMatter: A Mobile Application for Mood Tracking
Project for the course Applications Development and Emerging Technologies 3 (Mobile Programming)

## Project Description

The project will focus on the userâ€™s well-being and condition, especially during this pandemic. It aims to track the mood of the user each day and monitor his/her feelings throughout the month. This will help the user determine if he/she has been stressed lately and aims to give the user awareness if he/she is feeling stressed. The application comes along with daily motivational quotes for each day that will help lighten the mood of the user, especially in these times where even simple compliments or quotes can make the day of a person. Moreover, when the application detects that the user is feeling down at a higher rate (feeling sad or depressed consecutively for the week), will notify the user if he/she wants help from a professional hotline that cares for the mental health of the people. Hence, emergency hotlines are accessible in the application and the user may call them anytime through the using the application.
